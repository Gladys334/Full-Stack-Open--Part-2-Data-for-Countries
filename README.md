# Full Stack Open Part 2 – Data for Countries

This is my solution for the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open course, Part 2 (Data for Countries, steps 1–3).

You can see the project live here:  
👉 [Data for Countries on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/@Gladys334/collections/full-stack-open-data-for-countries)

The app shows information about countries and weather using data from APIs.
